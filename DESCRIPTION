Title: 105 data sets from "Introductory Econometrics" by Jeffrey M. Woolridge
Version: 1.0.0

Description: Students who find themselves new to both Econometrics and R may find the dual tasks of 
    mastering the material while learning R daunting. Econometrics is the focus, not data wrangling. 
    This package aims to help by handling data munging activities. It lazily loads all data sets used in
    the popular text "Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach, 5th Edition" by Jeffrey M. Woolridge. 
    All data sets have been cleaned, documented, and compressed into compact .RData files. 
    In addition, a vignette reproduces examples for 18 chapters of the book, offering a guide to R's model syntax.
Depends: R (>= 3.4.0)
