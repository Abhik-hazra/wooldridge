Description: Students exploring both econometrics and R may find the simultaneous 
    introduction to both challenging. However, if the text is "Introductory 
    Econometrics: A Modern Approach" by Jeffrey M. Wooldridge, they are in luck! 
    The wooldridge data package aims to lighten the task by efficiently loading 
    any data set from the text with a single command. Collectively, the data sets 
    have been efficiently compressed to a fraction of their original size and are 
    well documented. Help files conjtain relevant page numbers of the text, 
    the original source and time of publication, as well as notes which 
    offering ideas for further analysis, exploration, and research. To resurrect 
    a data set, simply load it with the `data()` function or load it lazily with 
    the `data =` argument of any model function. Provided the syntax is correct, 
    model estimates shall spring forth from the otherwise lifeless abyss of a 
    student's R console! If model syntax is an issue, a vignette contains code 
    and solutions to examples from each chapter of the text. Note: Data sets are 
    from the 5th edition (Wooldridge 2013, ISBN-13:978-1-111-53104-1), and are 
    compatible with all others.
