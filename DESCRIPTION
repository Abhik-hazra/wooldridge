Description: Economics students new to both Econometrics and R may find the tasks 
        of learning both a bit daunting. However, if your text is "Introductory 
        Econometrics: A Modern Approach" by Jeffrey M. Wooldridge, then you are 
        in luck! The `wooldridge` data package aims to lighten the task by loading 
        any data set from the text with a single command. In addition, a vignette 
        shows you how to recreate examples from every chapter of the text, offering 
        an introduction to R's statistical model syntax. Note: All data sets are 
        from the 5th edition (Wooldridge 2013, ISBN-13:978-1-111-53104-1), which 
        backward compatible with earlier editions.
