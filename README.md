For econometrics students new to statistical computing, loading data correctly 
can be a barrier to accessing the many statistical functions of the R language.
This package makes it effortless. Containing all 111 data sets discussed in 
**Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach, 6th Edition** by Jeffrey M. Wooldridge, the `wooldRidge` package effiiently loads them all.

In addition, all data sets have been compressed using the most efficient algorithm, at the highest level possible. This saves considerable space, compared to keeping
a heap of .csv or .xlsx files around.
