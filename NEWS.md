# wooldridge 1.1.1

##Updates to vignette

Fixed chapter 6 misspelling of the data set called within the load function. However, the example worked due to lazy loading of data, so I did not catch it before.

### Updated vignette Apendix items

While I have an old affinity for Farnsworth document, it contains outdated information. I removed it as it might do students more harm than good.

I added a citation for the book, Applied Econometrics with R. While I already cited the package above, it should go in the Appendix as well for those seeking to expand their knowledge beyond this text. 


# wooldridge 1.1.0

##Updates to vignette

I removed written descriptions of the example problems, putting more emphasis on viewing clean code. Short notes point to what function arguments are used or to various R packages. For descriptions of the examples and rational behind each problem, students should refer to their textbook as the content offered by Wooldridge is quite clear.

A bibliography section has been added, including package citations and their authors.

An Appendix has been added, pointing readers to a few excellent sources for computing Econometric models with R. These are "Econometrics in R" by Grant Farnsworth and "Using R for Introductory Econometrics" by Florian Hess.

##Updates to README.md 

Improved readability.
