# wooldridge 1.1.0

##Updates to vingette

One update here is removing descriptions of the examples, putting more emphasis on viewing clean code with short descriptions to describe what function arguments or to point out the use of various R packages. For descriptions of, and the rational behind example problems, students should refer to their text as content offered by Wooldridge is quite clear.

In addition, a bibliography section was added to cite packages and their authors.

An Appendix was also added, pointing readers to a few good sources for doing Econometrics with R.
